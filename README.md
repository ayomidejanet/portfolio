## Work Experience
**Data Scientist, Vella Finance (_May 2023 - September 2023_)** 
- Engaged in data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- Developed a recommendation system for personalized financial products using collaborative filtering algorithms.
- Developed a GARCH time series model for predicting asset volatility. 
- Obtained Stock data, utilized an API, cleaned and stored it in an SQLite database.
- Built an API to serve model predictions.

**Data Science Researcher, University of South Florida (_August 2021 - May 2023_)**
- Built and implemented K-means, Agglomerative and DBSCAN clustering to classify water molecules with 98% accuracy and mean absolute error less than 10%.
- Evaluated the models and selected the model with an almost perfect score of ARI, AMI, Homogeneity, Silhouette Score, and Completeness as the optimal model.
- Utilized cloud services (AWS) to architect and deploy the models. 


## Projects
### A/B Testing at WorldQuant University	                          
- Conducted a chi-square test to determine whether sending an email can increase program enrollment at WQU. 
- To implement a robust ETL process, I developed custom Python classes. 
- Furthermore, following a three-tiered design pattern, I created an interactive data application.

### Clustering Analysis of Molecular Snapshots
In this project, the aim was to classify and indicate the type of ice or liquid state for each snapshot of 250 water molecules where each line of the file represented the coordinates of 750 atoms, resulting in a total of 2250 columns.
To analyze this dataset effectively, I reshaped the feature vector of dimension 2250 into a 750 x 3 matrix, essentially creating a 750-dimensional array of 3D vectors. Next, I applied a clustering algorithm to the 1001 feature vectors, which captured the distinct clusters present in the snapshots.
To validate the quality of the clustering analysis, I performed elbow and silhouette analysis. These techniques helped identify the optimal cluster number and evaluated the separation quality within each cluster. Lastly, I deployed the optimal model on AWS sagemaker.

### Stellar Classification of Stars
The project focuses on analyzing and classifying astronomical data of stars using machine learning techniques. The main goal is to process the provided star data and train a model to classify stars based on their luminosity class and other features. Additionally, the project involves predicting the absolute magnitude of stars using empirical formulas.
